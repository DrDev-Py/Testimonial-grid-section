                                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                                encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                                about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                                very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, 
                                in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that 
                                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as 
                                an example of my development experiece. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                                full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
